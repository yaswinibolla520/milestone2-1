<h3>Clean, fresh water is a limited resource. With all the severe droughts happening in the world, the limited supply of fresh water is becoming one of our most precious resources. <i>Every person on earth needs water to survive</i>. Without it, many of us would get sick and even result in death.
<p>
While <b>almost 70% of the Earth is made up of water</b>, many parts of the world suffer from clean water shortage. Conserving water is important because it keeps water pure and clean while<u> protecting the environment.</u>
</p>
Conserving water means using our water supply wisely and be responsible. As every individual depends on water for livelihood, we must learn how to keep our limited supply of water pure and away from pollution. Keeping our water supply safe and pure will <big>protect the water for the generations to come.</big></h3>
